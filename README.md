# Exploring Istanbul’s Shopping and Tourism Economy - \*Work In-Progress\*

## **Problem Statement**
- How can our data-driven insights improve Istanbul’s retail and tourism sectors?  
- What can be done to encourage tourism-driven revenue for underrepresented areas?  
- How can malls better understand customer purchasing behaviors to optimize product offerings?  
- What products are the most and least popular across malls?  

---

## **Introduction**
In 2023, Turkey ranked 5th among the most popular tourist destinations worldwide, with **55.2 million international tourist arrivals**. Istanbul’s retail and tourism industries play a critical role in driving the city’s economy. This project aims to bridge the gap between customer behaviors, mall operations, and tourism trends through **machine learning (ML)** and **data analytics techniques**.  

By analyzing the Kaggle dataset on Istanbul’s shopping habits (2021–2023), we will provide actionable recommendations to:
- **Optimize customer interactions.**
- **Maximize profitability.**
- **Promote tourism in overlooked areas.**

---

## **Abstract**
Our team, **Sales Pioneers**, is dedicated to revolutionizing Istanbul’s shopping and tourism sectors. Using machine learning methodologies, we will:
- Identify customer preferences and purchasing behaviors.
- Analyze trends and patterns to deliver insights for retail optimization.
- Build predictive models to generate actionable recommendations.  

By combining quantitative and qualitative insights from the dataset, we aim to create strategies to help businesses attract tourists and enhance local revenue.

## **Dataset Overview**
The dataset includes customer shopping data with features such as:  
- **Demographics:** Gender, age  
- **Product Details:** Category, quantity, price  
- **Transaction Details:** Invoice ID, date, payment method  
- **Location Data:** Shopping mall name

## **Milestone 1: The Pitch**
### **1. Roles**
- **Basir:**  
  Responsible for creating visualizations and data storytelling. This includes crafting a dashboard for retailers to showcase customer behavior trends (age, gender, preferred malls, etc.).  
- **Team Members:**  
  - One will focus on **classification models** (Decision Trees, Rule-Based Methods, Naive Bayes).  
  - Another will focus on **clustering techniques** (K-Means and K-Mode).  
  - Data preprocessing and trend identification will be a collaborative effort.

> **Note:** These roles are flexible, and we will assist each other as needed!

### **2. Audience**
- **Retail Managers** and **Small Business Owners:** To enhance inventory planning and customer satisfaction.  
- **Tourism Authorities:** To promote underrepresented areas and boost tourism revenue.

---

### **3. Why Should Anyone Care?**
- Improve inventory planning and customer satisfaction for retailers.  
- Drive increased revenue for both retailers and tourism authorities.  
- Highlight opportunities to promote underrepresented areas in Istanbul.  

---

### **4. Approach**
We will:
- Explore correlations in pricing, sales trends, and demographics.  
- Use clustering models to segment customer behavior.  
- Test hypotheses using classification and clustering techniques.  

---

## **Milestone 2: Business Plan**
### **Hypotheses**
1. **H1:** Customers aged 18–30 are the most frequent buyers of electronic gadgets in Istanbul malls, and they prefer shopping on weekends using credit cards.  
2. **H2:** Customer demographics and mall-specific aspects significantly impact shopping behaviors, with widespread inclinations for clothing but variations in secondary choices based on mall offerings and lifestyles.  

---

### **Data Outputs and Metrics**
- **Classification Metrics:** Customer segmentation based on demographics and purchasing behaviors.  
- **Clustering Metrics:** Identification of common purchasing patterns and outlier behaviors.  
- **Sales Metrics:** Revenue trends for most popular vs. least popular product categories.  

---

## **Proposed Data Visualizations**
- **Demographics:** Age and gender distribution across malls using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.  
- **Location Insights:** Correlation heatmaps showing shopping frequency by mall location.  
- **Behavior Predictions:** Decision tree visualizations for customer behavior predictions.  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - One-hot encoding for non-numeric/categorical variables.  
  - Scaling numerical variables using SVM classification methods.  

---

## **General Questions**
- Do companies truly know their customers?  
- How can businesses bridge the gap between most popular and least popular products to maximize profits?  
- What strategies can companies employ to personalize customer interactions?
